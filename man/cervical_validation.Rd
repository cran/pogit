\description{
Additionally to the main study sample (see \code{\link{cervical}}), 
validation data are available that give information on how likely physicians 
from different countries are to identify and correctly report a true cervical 
cancer death. In that study, a sample of physicians in each country completed 
a death certificate for one specific patient who had died of cervical cancer 
and the number of correct death certificates in each country was recorded. 
Validation data are therefore available on country level but provide no 
information on the reporting probability specific for age.
