\title{Summary for posterior of a \code{pogit} object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{pogit}(object, IAT = FALSE, printRes = FALSE, ...)

\method{print}{summary.pogit}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{pogit}}

\item{IAT}{if \code{TRUE}, integrated autocorrelation times (IAT) and 
effective samples sizes (ESS) of the MCMC samples are computed (see 
details); defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{printRes}{if \code{TRUE}, model averaged posterior means for the 
reporting probabilities and risks are computed for the Pogit model; 
defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not used)}

\item{x}{a \code{summary.pogit} object produced by \code{summary.pogit()}}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{summary.pogit}
}
\description{
Returns basic information about the model and the priors, MCMC details and 
(model averaged) posterior means with 95\%-HPD intervals for the regression 
effects and estimated posterior inclusion probabilities.
}
\details{
To assess mixing and efficiency of MCMC sampling, the effective sample size 
(ESS) and the integrated autocorrelation time (IAT) are computed. ESS 
estimates the equivalent number of independent draws corresponding to the 
dependent MCMC draws and is defined as ESS = \eqn{M}/\eqn{\tau}, where \eqn{\tau} 
is the IAT and \eqn{M} is the number of MCMC iterations after the burn-in phase. 
IAT is computed as \eqn{\tau = 1 + 2 \sum_{k=1}^K \rho(k)}
using the initial monotone sequence estimator (Geyer, 1992) for K and 
\eqn{\rho(k)} is the empirical autocorrelation at lag \eqn{k}.
