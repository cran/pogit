\description{
The simulated data set \code{simul2} considers a situation with clustered 
observations and four binary covariates in both sub-models of the Pogit
model, i.e. 
\code{X} = \code{W}. The respective design matrix is
built by computing all 2^4 possible 0/1 combinations and one observation 
is generated for each covariate pattern. C=50 clusters are built containing 
one unit with each of the resulting 16 covariate patterns, i.e. a total of 
I=800 units. The regression effects are set to \code{beta = {0.75,0.1,0.1,0,0}}
in the Poisson and to \code{alpha = {2.2,-0.3,0,-0.3,0}} in the logit model. 
Random intercepts in both sub-models are simulated from a normal distribution
with standard deviations \eqn{\theta_\beta}=\code{0.1} and 
\eqn{\theta_\alpha}=\code{0.3}. Additionally to the main study sample, 
validation data are available for each covariate pattern and cluster. 
For details concerning the simulation setup, see Dvorzak and Wagner (2016).
