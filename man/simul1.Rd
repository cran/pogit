\description{
The simulated data set \code{simul1} considers a situation with four
binary covariates in both sub-models of the Pogit model, 
i.e. \code{X} = \code{W}.
The respective design matrix is built by computing all 2^4 possible 0/1 
combinations and one observation is generated for each covariate pattern. 
The regression effects are set to \code{beta = {0.75,0.5,-2,0,0}} in the 
Poisson and to \code{alpha = {2.2,-1.9,0,0,0}} in the logit model.
Additionally to the main study sample, validation data are available for
each covariate pattern. For details concerning the simulation setup, see 
Dvorzak and Wagner (2016).
